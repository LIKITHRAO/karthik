14-06-2018,126,1086,676,FALSE,1,Out of all the reviews I wrote This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!,Dead by Daylight
20-06-2017,85,2139,612,FALSE,1,Disclaimer I survivor main. I play games for fun not for competition so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops) and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with) then no biggie. Next game please I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one) I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up there is always the next game )That being said this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it have fun with it and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!) and even then recognize that there are jerks who play this game like any other game and have fun while you compete!,Dead by Daylight
12-12-2016,4,55,2694,FALSE,1,ENGLISH After playing for more than two years I am given the task of reviewing this game again.This review will be as complete as possible so if you do not want to see the full review I recommend you go to the final part of the review to see the opinion and final rating. This review will consist of 5 sections and some sub sections.GameplayThis game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors. For its part the killers must pursue hang sacrifice or kill the survivors.Survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks objects accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game.Offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as Pallets Windows 360's Moonwalks Hide Different powers in each killerThe balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game. Each update changes the balance making nerf or buff to the killer and survivors. In my opinion there are many things where the balancing is good. but there are many other things that fail a lot.Rating Balance 6/10 Mechanical system 9/10 Innovation 8/10 Gameplay 8/10Graphics It uses the graphic engine Unreal Engine 4 which is an engine with quite good lighting and easy to use with respect to other engines. In the graphic section optimization and animation Dead by Daylight is mediocre because there are enough graphic bugs or animation but it must be understood that Behaviour is not Epic game to be able to invest so much money in that aspect. Animation 6/10 Optimization 5/10 Graphics 6/10 Matchmaking In this aspect the game has improved a lot these 2 years but it's still quite mediocre there are quite a few bugs in looking for killers and supervients. The worst thing is that the host is the killer and there are no servers. And besides the rank system fails a lot there are games that can touch you ranks 20 being rank 1. Servers 0/10 Matchmaking 5/10 Conclusion This game has great potential for anyone who likes the "Slasher" or wants to spend good nights with friends or killing survivors. That potential is covered up by big bugs.

En cada actualizacion se cambia el balanceo haciendo nerf o buff a los killer y supervivientes.

Servidores 0/10 Matchmaking 5/10 Conclusión Este juego tiene un gran potencial para todo aquel que le guste el "Slasher" o que quiere pasar buenas noches con amigos o matando y haciendo enojar a supervivientes.

24-12-2018,295,219,71,FALSE,1,I have never been told to kill myself more than while playing this game.,Dead by Daylight
21-09-2018,2,54,400,FALSE,1,Any longtime Dead by Daylight player knows that this isn't a horror game. If you're looking for scares I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside I enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun. I give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing and so I will recommend.,Dead by Daylight
05-12-2018,380,271,414,FALSE,1,if you think cs go is toxic try this game,Dead by Daylight
04-12-2018,11,106,900,FALSE,1,This is simultaneously the most fun and most infuriating game I've played in a long time.It's an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.For an asymmetrical game it's in a state where it's surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other (Decisive Strike and No One Escapes Death are the current front runners) and certain killers are notoriously overpowered or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains for instance must hate themselves to play that and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.New content is regular 1 killer 1 survivor 3 perks for each side and a map are released every 3 months or so mid chapter balance patches occur and cosmetics are regularly added.There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage he sits in boring weak and generally unfun.Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around half the cast. Many are also available through grinding however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you unless they are picked on the "random" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this despite in game currency being used for cosmetics anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It's a move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.Awesome and incredibly angry community as you'd expect from a game like this.,Dead by Daylight

Where killing requires significantly more concentration survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles and the killers have completely different "powers" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play. It's just amazing and the game I turn on everyday for a good 6+ hours.,Dead by Daylight

29-03-2018,0,0,104,FALSE,1,Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Multiplayer horror action game.Interface/Menu/SettingsVideo Settings information. You are able to play on Low Quality Graphical settings. There is a resolution slidebar available. 0% 100% You are able to play this game on Fullscreen or windowed mode.Volume Settings Information. There is a main volume slidebar available. 0% 100% There is a Menu volume slidebar available. 0% 100% Headphones are recommended.Miscellaneous Information. There are alot of different languages available. You are able to play the game with a controller There is a mouse and controller sensitivity slidebar available. 0% 100% For Killer and survivor (both seperated). You are able to change the controls on the keyboard and controller. There is a manual Tutorial/help/tips available.About the game.You can choose between a Survivor or a killer. You are able to have 4 survivors in a match and 1 killer. Each side has an objective. The killer has to kill all 4 survivors in order to win while the survivors has to escape from the map. Survivors are using third person camera and killers are using a first person camera. Each survivor or a killer has their own level and perk system. So if you have unlocked an offering the offering can only be used in a match if you play that certain character.Survivors are able to use items and increase the effect of the item by adding add ons while the killer has a default power ability which can be improved by adding add ons. Offerings could be used to change the match or by gaining more points. The game is Trial and error and WILL BE DIFFICULT IN THE BEGINNING.While the game is pretty dark by itself you are able to increase the brightness by darkening your own room or increase the brightness on your computer monitor. This may have a little impact or no impact at all but if you are close to a window or the sun has the potential to shine into your room. You could be put in a disadvantage as you will have a hard time looking at the screen or able to see things properly. Killer needs to kill the 4 survivors in order to win. There are alot of different killers each with their own unique gameplay and perks. Some killers are able to go invisible or even stealth while other killers are using deadly tools to get their victims. The killer has a first person camera perspective which means he can't use their camera to look around the walls for victims. Killers are able to see ALL Generators and exit gates throughout the match which could help you locating survivors.You will have to hunt down the survivors and they could reveal themself on the map if they are failing a skillcheck helping a survivor off the hook or destroying a hex totem. Chasing a survivor will start the "Chase music" until the victim is down or escaped. An injured or a running survivor will leave a trail of red marks around the location which you need to track down in order to kill them. A killer is able to hear nearby "grunting/moaning" sound when a survivor is injured. The killer is able to kick generators to slow and decrease the generator progress or destroying thrown pallets by kicking them. Killers are generally faster than a survivor and the killer's movement speed will increase the longer the chase goes as they have "Bloodlust". Survivor needs to escape from the map by completing generators to power up the exit gate or they are able to find a hatch. There are alot of different survivors each with their own gameplay and perks. Some are good for co op actions while others are quickly. Survivors have a third person camera which will allow them to see around the walls and keep the killer at a distance. You will have to find generators to power up the exit gates to make your escape.Generators are randomly spawned on the map and could be located by looking up as you will see sparky flashlights. From time to time you will receive a skillcheck which you will need to success in order to prevent the generator blowing up and able to reveal your location on the game. Blowing up generators will lose some of your progess and could put you into danger as well. By reparing enough generators the exit gates will be powered up and you COULD leave the area after opening the gates. You could also find a hatch which will allow you to escape but the killer is able to grab you out of the hatch if he is quick enough.There are 2 hitchecks on a skillcheck The thick white bar and a smaller bar. Before the skillcheck will pop up you will hear a "ping" sound. Hitting the Bigger white bar will gain you more experience and you will gain 2% more progress but you are better off focusing on the smaller bar as it will be alot easier to hit. Most actions ingame require a skillcheck and missing a skillcheck will reveal your location to the killer. You are able to find items in crates such a medkit or a toolbox. Items has a quality level and make them more powerful the higher it is. Items are usually an one time thing as you will lose them if you have died or they run out of charges. You are able to to carry an item to the next match if you have escaped.The survivor is able to jump over windows throw down pallets or hide in lockers. Lockers are not a good hiding location and you will be instantly grabbed by the killer if spotted. You are better off crouching and hiding behind obstactles. A common mistake what people are doing is Running. If they see a killer and it is close to a survivor they have a tendency to run which will be a big mistake as this will reveal your location to the killer alot easier. You should only start running when you are being chased or you know for sure the killer isn't close to you.Ingame Information. Moderate replayability. Good Atmosphere. Dark graphical horror atmosphere. Has Perks and level systems. Each survivor/killer has their own system. Dialy randoms quests to gain an insane ammount of experience.Miscellaneous Information. Dwight and Nea are both good beginning characters. Worst enemies could be your allies while the killer could be your friend. Pallets are buggy Don't throw the pallet if you are facing it. It could teleport you to the other side and screw you over.Other things.The game isn't that fun as it may seem. Why? If you are playing as a killer you will fight against a bunch of "high" skilled trolls and they are usally pre made as well. They are mostly pallet/window jumping flashlighting and shamefully t bagging.If you are playing as a survivor you will play against a killer that may be alot better than you are. Sometimes teammates are disconnecting in a middle of the match which will leave you in a disadvantage they also have the tendecies to really screw you over. Sometimes even on purpose.Survivors are generally alot more toxic salty trolly and generally have a negative attitude than a killer will ever get in this game. Killers mostly relies on mistakes from the survivors and sometimes are more friendlier than a survivor.I will only suggest to buy this game whenever it is in a discount. Otherwise i would suggest to stay away from it. The idea of the game is nice Community however isn't and can be really frustating or game ruining.I have reached the text review limit. T T '( Reviews are always uploaded if i have at least played for 2 hours or more. Unless the game is really garbage and doesn't deserve the 2H limit.I Give this game a 7/10,Dead by Daylight

02-04-2018,0,0,178,FALSE,0,The game is completely unbalanced it doesn't make sense 90% of the time The killer always has some sort of advantage and the perks you get for the survivor is cheap the game is literally one of the worst games I have ever played. Until they fix the balancing of the game I will no longer make purchases nor will I reinstall this piece of onto my computer again. Yeah they finally update the game and just make it worse for the survivor you can get 15 000 blood points in a single game but if you don't escape you don't get a pip. Also the other players you survive with most of the time at the end of the game will intentionally run the killer to you so they can escape and they let you die.

If you're a fan of the horror genre you're going to love the Dead by Daylight. The game features licensed killers from classic horror films like Leatherface Michael Meyers and remade version of Freddy Krueger (which imo is a piece of they added quentin instead of literally anybody else). The downside to this is that alot of these characters are locked behind an in game purchase door. You're gonna have to pay more money than the fee to start playing the game if you want to play the cool characters. The game holds a strong incentive to play. You level up your killers/survivors you get cool perks you get cool items and you can also get prestige! If you like farming for completion this game will keep you occupied.Now the downside the game has all the issues other online games have. There is a serious balance issues however the devs are working on it and the game is more balanced than ever according to Dead by Daylight's subreddit. Playing survivor is literally playing baby mode while playing killer is like smashing your head against your keyboard. If you plan on playing with friends you can only play survivor unless you have enough for a full 1v4 but you will not earn any points for kill your friends gamemode. The community is also INCREDIBLY toxic. Toxic communities to me are a sign of an utterly unfun game for people become toxic because the game angers them so much. And that is true. While you may have good games occasionally you will also have terrible games and those trials will put your mind to hell. Think of the game similar to CS GO and LoL. Toxic community hard core disconnectors garbonzo matchmaking yada yada.In the end the game is still great. If you enjoy competitive games this will be your type of game. If you want a high skill ceiling game play killer. If you want to play by dragging your balls from left to right on your keyboard and still win play survivor.TL DRThe game is not for everyone but most people will enjoy it to some degree. By the way if you bm as a survivor you are the degenerate scum that deserves to get shot down in the streets.,Dead by Daylight

22-09-2018,0,0,230,FALSE,1,This game and i have a love hate relationship. The forums are filled with nothing but killers complaining about survivors being OP and survivors complaining about killers being OP.. Truth be told the game is fun when playing againsts a killer who is fair and doesn't tunnel the heck out of you or camp you. in the end the bad players make the game non fun.Pls add a block option so players can avoid killers/survives who are either toxic or campers so they can avoid future matches with them tyKillers drop you when you thinking it will prevent you from struggling off their shoulder. NEWS it doesn't reset struggle timer. YOU tell survivors get good or you would not get hit or hooked. same goes to you if you have to use these tactics to win you're just unskilled or lazy.the pt system is so way off .. the killer if they do it right can leave easily with 40K plus pts this is even when they lazy and if a survive works their asses off they might get 20 to 30K? more often than not when using even bloody party streamers killer aims to kill as fast as possible and survivor leaves with 3K.That is if they are lucky but a killer is garenteed at least 12K if they only hook 2 survives.No wonders so many play killer .Wish they had a kill your friends that earned you bp and not ranks that would allow players to play for fun and skip being trolled by killers taking out non toxic players.Doing this as well will lower idiotic wait times for killers because it seems too many want to be "evil" just cause of event or it's easy bp and they having a bad day and want to take their negativity out on survives.Killers claim that survives are over powered but you got the doctor that has a ability that can hit survives pretty much a quarter if not more of the map.I am an unskilled killer who can down survives in second on the doctor if I chose. YOU got the pig who can pretty much have 0 terror radious sneak up on you add in the massive debuffsa then what the head trap. In the movie yes Amanda had to get it off alone because she was alone however in the game survives are NOT alone. Why not make someone get teammate get it off with the rule of them having to have a tool kit?I mean amanda didn't have a killer grabbing her while getting what she needed for the trap to come off. Due to killers tunneling the hell out of you there is no way to get it off your head unless the pig doesn't tunnel.I have had 10 pig killers troll the fk out of me .I see pig I will leave the game or just die on first hook. PIG induces toxic killers .I am not a sore loser give me fair game play without tunnel or camping I am happy win or lose. survives can be as toxic as well.A game should be fun competetive or not in the end we all here to enjoy a game. Some want to have all wins that is okay too but that isn't gonna happen. If you lose fairly respect that.,Dead by Daylight

23-11-2016,0,0,65,FALSE,1,Yes I would definitely recommend this game. Sure it has a ton of bugs but its not like its the only game that has bugs. This game (Though it isn't in beta) is still a work in progress with a complex leveling system and new things being added every few weeks or so. Saying "THIS GAME HAS TOO MANY BUGS" is like saying "MARIO IS TOO 3D." It's part of the game. Reporting a bug won't fix it right away. The Devs need some time to make the patch and program the game.To all of y'all who think you can do better than the Devs why don't you try to satisfy WAY over 10 000 people worldwide. THESE GAMES AREN'T EXACTLY EASY TO MAKE. So everyone who doesn't recommend this game JUST BECAUSE OF THE FREAKIN' BUGS why don't you go to a tech university or college and why don't you study programing. Then I would like to see how far anything that you make goes. Bugs in games aren't intentional. They are programing/ modeling errors. Every game is TRIAL AND ERROR.Grand Theft Auto had a ton of bugs rockstar fixed it. Super Smash Bros had a ton of bugs and nintendo fixed it. Don't you think the devs will try to fix the bugs in this game? Yes they will. Even if it take months.This game is fun and a few bugs here and there might ruin one or two rounds but I don't think its fair that you don't recommend this game because you're salty you can't win a match. Whether you being a killer and the hook is blocked or being a survivor floating in the air for the killer to see. This is my favorite game as of right now.For all of you who took the time to read this rant Thank You. &lt 3,Dead by Daylight

17-08-2016,0,0,526,FALSE,1,I have to start by saying that I picked this game up for something to do in my down time in between other games when I get bored. I couldnt have gotten luckier with buying this. Now that is not to say that it is not a pretty and polished finished project. There are still issues that need to be fixed but that said that game is still very fun!!! This game when from something I would play occasionaly to one of my main games. ( I dont think there are many others out there that can say the same thing with a price tag of $20) The only warning that I can give to those who are looking to buy this game is that it HIGHLY and I mean HIGHLY FAVORS THE KILLERS. This does not mean that playing survivor is not fun but it is easly more a challange which in my opinion makes the game much more fun. Think of this like dark souls only you cant fight back you can only run. If you are looking for a great game on a budget then give this one a chance.

Takes far too long to join a lobby with friends especially with a group of four. The game crashes on me 25% of the time when trying to join a lobby solo. You can get around this by starting the match as "Survive with Friends" and join a lobby without inviting anyone.Matchmaking is especially challenging with friends PST nights so Dead by Daylight is aptly named. But if you're going to play solo now that I found the workaround above for joining games it's good fun.,Dead by Daylight

How would you feel hiding behind a corner hoping nothing is lurking just around it? How exhilerating is it when you find your victim and you give chase?This is what this game explores and it does so perfectly! The simplified UI as to not distract you from the hunt relying solely on audio cues (with a little extra help for the killer since they are supposed to be supernatural) to navigate the little area.They play the suspense role flawlessly you are at the edge of your seat when you start running (whether you are running to kill or avoid being killed.)I highly recommend this game to anyone into the horror genre! It does get repetitive and I am starting to have trouble finding the motivation to keep playing the same maps over and over again. However this is certainly something that I will open back up every October!,Dead by Daylight

14-06-2016,1,1,322,FALSE,1,Dead by Daylight is a very interesting game. Bringing us into the land of Slasher horror films. Something not a lot of games venture into if at all.You can play as a Slasher or a Survivor. Survivors have a third person perspective and have audio cues to know if the Slasher is close but not its exact position. A small red light on the ground shows the Killer's vision letting you know the Killer is RIGHT behind you when you're being chased if you even DARE to look back. When you're being chased the Slasher is slightly faster. But this is balanced out with ways to avoid the killer. Throwing down pallets to block him while you run off in tall grass or hide in a closet or something. Your objective is to activate 5 generators with 3 other survivors and then escape. Sounds simple but it's a lot harder than it sounds. There is no voice chat in ranked matches so plans cannot be made.There are three Slashers each with different abilities. You have the Trapper who uses Bear Traps to trap survivors in choke points during chases or stop them getting to the generators from helping survivors etc. The Wraith who has a cloaking ability. Many users are complaining that this slasher is Overpowered. The cloaking prevents survivors from hearing the audio cue that plays when the Slasher is near. However before the Wraith can go invisible a bell toll plays announcing that he's cloaking. Players then have the option of continuing what they're doing or be more careful.Then you have the Hillbilly that has a Chainsaw dash ability able to cut down a survivor in one fell swoop.All three of the Slashers have a melee weapon that takes down a survivor in two hits. One makes them bleed two downs them to a crawl. When slashing there's a slight cooldown for when you hit a survivor. When you hit a survivor the Slasher wipes the blood onto his sleeve and he slows down for a few seconds allowing the Survivor to get a headstart. Fair trade in my opineon. If the slasher was able to do two swings in rapid succession it wouldn't be very fair.The goal of the Slasher no matter the type is to either kill or sacrifice all the Survivors by putting them on meat hooks. Once again this is harder than it sounds. Survivors can help eachother getting others off meathooks healing eachother helping repair the Generators etc.The game has one core gameplay mode but two ways to do it. Ranked is as simple as it sounds. Play as a Slasher or Survivor against random online people. Or you can do Kill Your Friends mode which is the same but in a private match for at least 2 people(One person HAS to be the Slasher). Now the big difference between the two. In ranked mode you score blood points which you can use to upgrade your character. Give them new perks and items to use. However in Kill Your Friends this stuff is blocked. I'm guessing this is mainly to stop people from farming points. If this is something that bothers you you might not want to spend money on this. Be warned.Speaking of points. There is a character customization point or loadout. Which allows you to add items to your character.(As stated above) There's not many choices of clothing and cosmetics as of yet. This is likely to be added in future updates along with new play modes.Maps are of relatively medium to large size all of which are dark and forboding and are procedurally generated. Generators in a place you might know now will be switched in different plays.I think this game is quite fun and is a pretty good horror game that will make you tense up.Price is pretty damn low for something of this kind of quality only $20. Ten dollars more if you want the Deluxe edition.Go ahead and get this game if you wish and enjoy yourself you masochistic maniac you.,Dead by Daylight
24-11-2018,0,0,822,FALSE,1,so after 700+ hrs of playing this game i still love playing this game. it does have its flaws but after 2 years since it came out the devs still come out with new content survivors/killer plus always a new map to play in so hope they keep coming out with new stuff and i do recomend this game to anyone specially playing with a group of friends,Dead by Daylight
14-06-2016,0,0,8,FALSE,1,Very fun game so far. Great atmosphere that relies heavily on sound. Fun game to play with friends but it is stiil fun solo and definetly scary solo. As a fan of horror games I would recommend this game. Only cons that stand out are it takes awhile to find a game and the wraith seems better than the other 2 killers. The wraith's power may need to be nerfed a bit i.e. maybe he shouldn't also speed up with invisibility.,Dead by Daylight

14-06-2016,0,0,11,FALSE,1,The game its self is amazing. It is one of the best games i have played. The largest problem i have with it is it takes FOREVER to find a game as a killer.edit it seems that more people are playing this game now so it is much faster to find a game now.edit 2 the escape hatch really needs some rebalancing. right now it is practicly a guarantee that the last survivor will escape. if they made it so the hatch only opened if there is only 1 or 2 generators left or made it so it does not open at all but make the key to it more common to find i think it would feel a bit more balanced.,Dead by Daylight

It's proven to me again and again that I can still love a game that is broken just like many others I own. If I were to say if I recommend the game then I would personally say yes. I enjoy playing with friends sometimes on my own and I can enjoy playing the game as killer. I'd just say that you have to be patient. Don't take the game seriously just play the game as it is a game and if you have a bad time during one game leave a gg and just move on. You'll have a much better time that way.

Still overall its definitely a fun game,Dead by Daylight

27-10-2017,0,0,1420,FALSE,1,Edited 7/27/2018Honestly? The game is so much better than it was when I originally reviewed it and still much better after I edited my initial review. I'm gonna keep the old review in but in parenthesis. That review is outdated but feel free to read it.Since the dead by daylight team at bhvr seperated from starbreeze I have been nothing but impressed. They have a very voherent plan laid out for their game and it seems like they are actually focusing on making a game they love rather than making it for money. The changes are well welcomed the balance changes were much needed and the pallet changes are excellent. Most of the negative reviews you will see on this game recently are people very upset about the balance changes. The balance changes have actually made things more balanced and they don't like it because they aren't as good anymore. Which is understandable since if you bought the game for that reason and don't get that feeling anymore I would also be disappointed but you also have to realise this is more how the game was envisioned.The community for this game is to be honest terrible. Only in rust have I seen a community more toxic and abysmal than the Dead by Daylight community. However the game is still extremely enjoyable and fun and you can also just hide the chat so you don't have to deal with people. All in all this game is easily one of my favorites and I only see it getting better in the future.However I still stand fully by my statement that the doctor is the actual worst part of any video game I have EVER played. But that's just an opinion.TL DR This game is fun the community is the devs are working on making the game a better experience and I couldn't be happier with the direction they're going.8/10 OUTDATED REVIEW BELOW (This game is very fun though also extremely frustrating due to mechanics and the way players interpret those mechanics into some less than fun playstyles. The game has always been fun but i would not have reccommended it back when i first got the game or even just a few months ago. i believe that with the seperation from starbreeze bhvr can really make this game into something great that i know it can be and so far from what ive seen in te dev streams and the roadmap they're pushing for that as well. It is by no means a perfect game and they refuse to patch the biggest bug in the entire game (The Doctor) but it is an enjoyable experience when you can get past all the upset people telling you to off yourself.),Dead by Daylight

17-02-2017,0,0,208,FALSE,0,Was a fun game at launch many bugs as was to be expected but at this point the amount of bugs is unacceptable. Each update breaks more than it fixes and the devs have given up on listening to the community whatsoever. Communication between the devs and community was already pretty bad but now they just pump out awful buffs and nerfs that usually aren't needed cuz it seems like they listen to the extremely loud whiners rather than looking at the data and proper feedback. The gameplay has become stale frustrating unfair and not worth playing. DLC is heavily overpriced and is usually nothing good maybe a new killer that's overpowered and eventually gets a nerf or some crappy accessories. Don't buy this crap used to be good but now it's far from it.,Dead by Daylight
17-02-2017,1,1,93,FALSE,0,Game was nice and fun i enjoyed playing it. You can feel the thrill being chased by the killer when playing as a survivor and one match doesn't take time too long even though this game is a PvP game.the cons are the matchmaking system is weird and maybe i spent 60% of my total playtime in game just to search matches. But i can still tolerate it because if you actually know when to play it doesn't take time that long. But the real prob is everytime this game releases a new patch and you update the game it becomes worse for no reason. On the first patch my fps dropped from 40 50 to around 20 30 and after i updated the latest patch(today's patch). The game becomes literally unplayable. i can't even get into the main menu. the game tells me to verify the game but it fixes nothing. So the conclusion is for you guys who want to play this game Don't buy it if you're not lucky enough. Because actually this game worked for some people that are lucky.,Dead by Daylight

13-10-2017,0,0,510,FALSE,1,This is a tricky review to write... The game is pretty well made and pretty well balanced. It's difficult to survive as a survivor and to kill as the killer so it does all even out although some of the DLC killers are OP and a little unfair IMO. As the survivor you have to repair generators open the exits and run around/hide trying to avoid the killer... as the killer you just need to stop the survivors and put up with being called a camper no matter how far away you go from your hooked victims. Seriously the community is salty... VERY salty... The game can be a little repetitive but because of all the unlocks it does have good replayability and so I would recommend the game. However be aware the community is pretty toxic and it is very frustrating to play at times.,Dead by Daylight

Yes i agree the killer is pretty strong right now but i have only actually died 4 times since the patch yesterday. Also these people just got the game. Instead of learning how to play better they leave a negative review that feels more like a rant.Into the review. Yes the game is pretty buggy. But the devs are awesome. There was 4 hot fixes in one day to address various bugs and matchmaking. Also the devs stream and let us know whats on their prioirty list and was being taken care of. This dev team is super vocal and i love it.Pros A fun challenge for both sides. A great dev team. A great game to play with friends. The game doesn't feel repetitive. Only $20.Cons Matchmaking was rough but its been getting better since the last patch. They've been nerfing the survivors a lot lately but ive learned to adapt and still win games all the time.

21-08-2016,0,0,155,FALSE,1,Okay..I kinda have mixed feelings about this. And it's not about the gameplay. It's about duo queue. It is way to bugged right now. I hope they fix that. Everytime you don't find a match you have to press "READY" again. And sometimes your party goes to a seperate lobby and you have to invite them again.Other then that I absolutly love this game.

The bad things about the game is that it's buggy and it hasn't that much to it yet. I find myself in weird screens when trying to join lobbies and the game lags from time to time even though my computer can handle it pretty well. Still not something that isn't unplayable. Personally I'd want more game modes and customization options but I'm sure that will come later. I recomend it if you like this kind of game and if you aren't too worried about bugs and lack of features. I like it for what it is right now. It's simple and fun.,Dead by Daylight

23-09-2017,0,0,332,FALSE,1,Absolutely a great game. Can be fun to play both solo and with friends. High tactical and mechanical skill cap. Don't get me wrong it's got its bugs but it is very clear that the devs are actively working to patch and rebalance the game while also consistently adding new content to the game.One major issue with the game is the "loss of save file" bug. THIS CAN BE PREVENTED by manually backing up your save files every so often (just a simple copy/paste). However I disregarded this advice myself only to lose 225 hours of progress when the Steam servers went down. I proceeded to email the devs to resolve the issue. After about two weeks I finally got all my progress back. I was also able to continue playing in the meantime and got to keep any bloodpoints I had earned in that period. I admire the developers of this game for actually taking the time to look into such issues and keeping in contact with their playerbase as so many other small studios fail to do.Update 310 hours in and this game is still great. Devs continue to do their best to balance everything.TL DR If you want a competetive tactical 4v1 game definitely consider this. Devs do a really good job with updates and communication.

27-06-2016,0,0,564,FALSE,0,This game has become a mediocre game from when it first started in 2016 I rated this game 8/10 however I am giving it 4/10 going forward. Never mind the 450+ hours I ve clocked but the entire experience has been dreadful i've never played a game that frustrates me as much as this one. From killers camping &amp wrecking the game survivors simply disconnecting randomly when they sense they're gonna lose you name it.1.) Firstly they have this stupid Season Reset system which resets player's Ranks every so often. What this means is that everyone essentially starts back at Rank 16 20. So a person with 3 000 hours as a killer may face 3 4 survivors with 50+ hours and annihilate the game (and vice versa). This creates a very unfair game and you would want to quit as a new starter.2.) Unlike other team games (like TF2) where you can still carry across if you end up with dudd player or 2 (from the 4) this game heavily relies on ALL 4 so if you have a bad one in your team you'll most likely all end up dead3.) The Devs seem to Buff &amp Nerf various killers/survivors very frequently you can never master a player without either that playing being buffed or nerfed. This shows that after 2 years the game is imbalanced.4.) They try and discourage the killers from camping however they create perks that simply promote it like Dying Light where you have to kill 1 specific survivor to gain an advantage.Sorry for the new comers who don't understand some of the points above as they're specific but don't spend $19.99 unless you've played imbalanced games and happy to try and have fun.,Dead by Daylight

26-10-2017,0,0,90,FALSE,1,Dead by Daylight is one of the most entertaining co op games I have ever laid hands on. Everything about the game is excellent asthetically there are some questionable underlying gameplay issues that leave room for improvement. The premise of the game is wonderful 4 defenseless survivors have to hide and attempt escape from a powerful supernatural killer. The game is an entertainment experience that fills me with a variety of feelings and emotions (mostly panic and fear). The music is intense and erratic adding to the feeling of hectic hopelessness. The environments are dark and dingy and the random spawn locations adds to the feeling of isolation. The sound of the approaching killer and the slaughter of a nearby teammate causes involuntary clenching that I rarely experience from video games. DbD is wildly fun to play with some friends as you can either be extremely goal oriented to work together to try and escape or you can play to rescue each other and try to create some highlights that belong on ESPN. There are some balancing issues with the various perks and attachments available to players but that is to be expected with any "competetive" player vs player game. The developers are much better now at acknowledging these issues and fixing them in a relatively timely matter. Overall I would highly recommend this game especially if you can pick it up for a decent sale price!,Dead by Daylight

28-11-2016,0,0,19,FALSE,1,a great and exilarating game to play with a group of friends or with people online if you are up for the intense anonimity.,Dead by Daylight
23-06-2017,0,0,169,FALSE,1,If you have a bad temper I wouldn't recommend this game. There's so many camping killers and selfish survivors. I think the game mechanics are too reliant on your perks and fellow survivors where as without the proper perk you cant heal after being injured nor can you escape the hook without another survivor saving which they can take advantage of you and use you as a diversion/sacrifice to espace on their own and get their extra XP.What I have to say for the future of the game's development is that The killer shouldn't be allowed without 2 feet of a hanging body unless another survivors enters the invisible barrier while the killer is allowed to enter the invisible barrier upon the other survivor entering where the killer may hack at the hanged survivor's savior or go after the pre hanged survivor to finish them off. While I think the hanged victim should remain immue while in the invisible barrier of the hook to avoid campers to constantly pick them of. But if the previously hanged victim remains in the invisible barrier for more than 10 seconds the invisible barrier vanishes and the killer is free to go all in at the survivor. However the survivor's savior will not be immune while in this barrier if the killer is within 1 foot of them.In the most recent update for Dead By Daylight's Anniversary Match Making took a major turn for the better. I used to queue up with 3 friends and it took 2 hours for us to find a match. Developers finally patched this and match making is quicer and it's much more reliable if you want to have a quick match then having to find friends to create a private match with.I personally think the bugging and some of the dlc killers need to be patched/fixed because things such as Michael Myer's not having a heartbeat outside of stalking and The Hag's teleport is just ridiculous and overpowered. I also think Michael Myers and The Hag's speed should be lowered some I was one shot by a Michael Myers while he chased for for bout 3 seconds as he hung my body my friend came to save me as she was also one shot. One game with the hag I was found at the beginning of the game where the hag used her incredible speed to catch me and knock me down as she hung me She camped me. Meg Thomas and William "Bill" Overbeck had both been knocked down attempting to save me as the other survivor cowarded out as The Hag hung and killed each of us off one by one.I would recommend because overall it's a fun experience expect for when you want to win and you get camped by a bunch a s. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't want to play a game that's so early in development and hasnt had time to reach it's full potential. If you are here to simply have fun and enjoy the experience of Dead By Daylight as the game rises to greatness then this is the game for you.Good Luck don't get slaughtered!,Dead by Daylight

04-06-2017,0,0,500,FALSE,1,At first I just saw annoying gameplay where teamwork dosen't exist and constantly getting ganged up on as killer. But as I ranked up players stoped using cheap tactics and overall the toxicity subsided. It's an interesting concept with the killer using various abilities (depending on the killer) to hunt down survivors and hang them on hooks. This is a big deal since there's only 4 survivors killing them as soon as you catch them all the time would make the game to fast. Speaking of survivors they have to power 5 generators (which they all somehow know how to do) to open a door and escape. After all the generators are done there's still the matter of opening the doors. This was pretty clever of the devs. Just because the exit is there dosen't mean the killer can't stop you. You could be right there in front of the exit but a fellow survivor is stuck on a hook. You can either leave the game (and get salt) or risk your life. Many people say gens progress too fast. But I say it's a good choice. DbD has no way of chatting mid game unless you use something like Discord or Skype so coordinating outside of a private chat is hard. Faster gens will compensate for that.I have two problems with this game however. One problem is what the devs are doing with this game. They said they're not dealing with scummy tactics like face camping (Staying right by a hooked survivor) or pallet looping (dropping a pallet to block the killer and just leaping over it whenever the killer gets to close.) Though if you have a group of friends to play with (which I don't ) you can work around face campers and with pallet looping you can just ignore the troll and partol some generators.My 2nd problem is the community. Both killer mains and survivor mains alike can be annoying. While killers are usualy ok there's a camper every now and then that will just tell you git gud. Survivors are even worse in my opinion. A toxic survivor will usualy get mad at "camping" (which to them is just staying on the same half of the map as a hooked survivor.) And act like they're compleatly innocent. This is never the case. Suvivors can be found palletlooping windowlooping flashlight spamming bodyblocking etc. while asking for respect the whole time. A toxic survivor can easily be compared to a spoiled 6 8 year old brat. However the community is a mixed bag. Every now and then you get paired with a fair respectable group that are good winners and losers. Those kinds of games always make my day no matter how well I actully preform in the match.All in all DbD is a pretty good horror survival game that you can pour many hours into. I reccomend it.,Dead by Daylight
18-03-2017,0,0,29,FALSE,1,Ok so after I played way more hours I think I can update a little bit my review.GRAPHIC 6/10AUDIO 7/10GAMEPLAY 8/10COMMUNITY NA/10PRICE FOR THE VALUE 10/10OVERALL 8/10Now in details GRAPHICS Not much to say here it makes what it has to make but even though it use the Unreal Engine and Autodesk Scale something the graphic is compareable at Halflife 2 with some extra poligons. It could be Paragon...it's crap...but a 6 because it is sufficient to enjoy the game (SUFFICIENT).AUDIO The music itself is ok nothing too good nothing too bad but all the tiny details the screams the footsteps and more it makes the experience really enjoyable but doesn't excell.GAMEPLAY Funny and addictive probably at long it will get boring as Survivors doesn't have any ability other than run and Killers has just 1 ability that most of the time is crap. I would like few more abilities like a moba but still the game is enjoyable and I keep playing and want to play more so is more than ok.I have to admit that the matchmaking is somehow broken (doesn't exist) and sometimes as a beginner I find myself against people that played probably for months (you can see that from the PERKS they have PERKS are items that increase your performance and you get them levelling up).This for now didn't ruin my experience I took it as it is sometimes the game is harder (they have more level) sometimes easyer (I do) no matter what you will take your experience (bloodpoints) to get level and sometimes is fun to try to beat someone stronger than you (and sometimes it happen and is SO GOOD).COMMUNITY Everyone in other reviews blame the toxic community...HOW? There is no in game chat of any kind you start a game you end a game you leave! At the start and end of a game you can chat IF YOU WANT and the few times I did everyone was nice (nice game gg had fun and so on).If people think that this is a toxic community probably they never tried League of Legend or any moba in general!Then of course unskilled players will always complain and blame on others....they are everywhere! There are people complaining about camping (Killer stay at the hang after hanged a survivor waiting for his death) and sometimes I do that...sometimes survivors got away with that grouping up using items (flashlight that blind the killer and more) and this is how it should be played but noobs doesn't know how to do that and blame the killer...just noobs being noobs!Still community is ok (I even posted on the community site here on Steam and they answered in a really polite way explaining me few things of the game).PRICE FOR THE VALUE 12.99 when on offer 19.99 full price...I pay that when I go out for a dinner few hours and what I eat will become poop ... for the fun I had until now I am already ok and happy to have paid those money.OVERALL Great game probably not for all I didn't meet any of the problems that blamers wrote in other reviews.I had really few problems with the lobby (maybe 10 times I click on start game and after less than 30 seconds I am back to the main menu) but is nothing that ruined at all my experience with the game.Probably who blame about it has crappy computer or internet connection often happens I work in customer service and "why I can't use your software on facebook everything works fine so my internet is great"...it's their problem and they should get a decent computer and internet connection before playing games online...or they should go playing with a console maybe offline thou...the game WORKS PERFECTLY.All my games as survivor or as killer starts in less than a minute (well lets say 2 minutes as after the game has to load and that takes usually longer than the waiting for a full lobby).That about the lobby sometimes (1 out of 5 maybe) as the game session rely on one host (that is a player) the game become laggy almost unplayable (well totally unpleyable) just die get anyway a little experience and start a new game worst case scenario will take 10 minutes.Overall this game worth to be played absolutly worth the price and it works fine.If you do not like survival horror or multiplayer game leave this game be otherwise really try it worst case scenario you trashed 12.99 (but I am sure that most of you attracted by this game will enjoy it ... people who will not enjoy it would not even have the doubt to buy it or not).All this people blaming this game for internet connection and stuff should try a triple A game 69.99 like For Honor where there are way more connectivity issues and bug on a 5 times the price game from a such famous publisher (damn you Ubisoft....damn you).,Dead by Daylight

20-06-2017,0,0,870,FALSE,1,I've played this game for a long time. I started from the very beginning with just three killers and four survivors. I've been through every DLC update community outburst and horrible patch update. I can say for sure that this game is absolutely worth it to play. The recent anniversary event was fantastic and brought a lot of people back including myself. The developers have actually improved themselves and listen to the community much better than they did before. Now I look forward to patch updates. They constantly add new map variations to old maps which is a very nice addition to the game. They also ACTUALLY FIXED the horrible queueing system from the past! They also added loading bars which provides so much clarity in case you do crash. With different promises such as console releases a new chapter for free coming up and community support there is no better time to pick this game up. It's also a very reasonable price gate to begin playing at $20 without sales.Simply put this game is just extremely fun. There is something really addicting about running away from the killer or murdering every survivor on the map. The problem was in the past the developers were hurting the game's growth through different means. Now it can't be farther from the truth.Is this game perfect? ABSOLUTELY NOT. There are still a lot of bugs peer to peer connection and face camping.Even with the flaws I recommend you pick this game up. Before I couldn't say this with certainty. Now I can. You won't regret it.,Dead by Daylight

Good for couple of games and having fun. That's it.,Dead by Daylight
02-07-2017,0,0,82,FALSE,0,I definitely can't recommend this game. The premise and even the gameplay are incredibly compelling but execution is sloppy on so many fronts.Icons numbers and game concepts are explained so vaguely (or not at all) in game that it's difficult to grasp intricacies beyond the basic premise. The wiki has more detail but it's not always enough. It can be helpful to play as a survivor or killer to learn their special abilities but if they're behind the DLC paywall you might never really understand exactly how they work.There are a lot of game design choices that feel bad. If you take items with you on a round you'll lose them always if you're the killer and if you die as a survivor. Since it's impossible to know before a match begins whether it will be a close fight or a struggle for either side there's not much in the way of tactics when making the decision to bring gear along. So most of the progress through the bloodweb is transient and not very meaningful.There's no meaningful matchmaking. I've played with teams of all first time playing level 5 rank 20 survivors and ended up in games with rank 1 killers sporting huge perk and add on loadouts. What a terrible experience to expose new players to. The last game I played the killer took out 3 of us and then proceeded to carry the last survivor around the map holding the player hostage for 15 20 minutes while they racked up points. The player might wiggle free only to be chased struck down and carried back again once more. Since none of the generators were on the trap door wasn't available and there was no way for the player to escape or finish the job due to the killer's detection perks. Without any sort of time limit or event to break long term stalemates players have only two options wait until their opponent gets bored or disconnect and suffer huge point losses.The software decisions are really sloppy. Finish a game with friends? Your party is disbanded and you are put into a different game mode. Have a killer quit your lobby? Your party is disbanded. Temporary connectivity issue with the servers while trying to load a game? The game shuts down entirely. Accidentally get disconnected from the game? No way to reconnect. Interacting with the game is a chore.Fun trick about the game shutting itself down if you wait a few seconds after it tells you it needs to shut down and asks you to click "Ok" you can instead hit Alt F4 which will pull up an "Are you sure you want to quit" dialogue instead. On that dialogue you can hit cancel and skip the whole automatic restart thing which merely confirms that there was no reason for the game to shut down in the first place.This game *is* a lot of fun if you can find 5 friends of similar skill and experience to play it with together. Of course this requires dropping a collective $60+ on a title that doesn't have much value outside of that very specific use case. The rest of it is pretty thoroughly bad though. A pity too since the core of the gameplay though simple is very compelling.,Dead by Daylight
28-06-2017,0,0,248,FALSE,1,This is sort of a mixed review. I love this game a lot it's fun with friends and overall I enjoy it.

03-07-2016,1,2,170,FALSE,1,Positives The killer and survivor designs play styles and perks. The map designs and artwork. The fear the game's music and atmosphere creates for the survivors. Controls are simple and easy to learn. Gameplay (when the game works as intended) is fun for the killer and intense and scary for the survivors.Negatives Current gameplay is buggy at times. The game should have remained in early access for a few more weeks. There is no Looking for Group option at this time. You can either queue for randoms and click back and re queue until you find your friends or you can play a game with your friends but without a full party (unless you have the friends to create a full party). I definitely recommend this game to people but anyone playing should expect bugs ranging from funny (survivors floating through the air instead of running) to game breaking (survivors stuck in trees after being saved from the hook). The DBD devs are working out these kinks and have already released 2 patches and multiple hotfixes since the game's release earlier this month.,Dead by Daylight

20-08-2016,3,1,32,FALSE,1,Honestly this game deserves Much more praise. the whole feeling to the game is amazing and the soundtrack is so thematic and really puts you on edge. The gameplay is nearly solid with a few screw ups. such as range of weapons (for example getting hit while already vaulted away from a window and was a step away from the opening) thats about it.Pros! great soundtrack Very VERY fun with friends the character design is wonderful. The killers have this nice familiar but original feel to them. Map design is IN my opinion great! the perks and addons for each character cand really help you out at times! Cons! Rarely you are randomly kicked out of a match with no reason told Nurse is just annoying not really a bad con (It can be avoided easily if your a regular to dodging the hunnies) it would actually be cool to have some seperate lobby music. something similar to what it is now. but i like the song so much i dont want to hear it over and over again and get bored. (but it does have a very long runtime and has awesome sounding parts so its not just an annoying short loop. The game is a very fun game to me and i dont think it deserves all this hate!sure the matchmaking connectivity can be a little annoying. but its just because its free weekend currently. and its pairing you with squads of survivors who can be people in 3s looking for 1 more person or a squad of 2 looking for 2 more. just a player group complaint and i cant say thats a bad game bug or design. its mostly player complaint.I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME WITH ALL MY HEART,Dead by Daylight

13-12-2017,0,0,34,FALSE,0,Awesome concept game.Graphics are best killers are only available in DLC (pay2win) and the whole game is riddled with bugs. Like I said the idea is great but it's like the devs put in the least possible effort to make it come to be. Huge disappointment.,Dead by Daylight
21-07-2016,0,0,28,FALSE,0,Good concept for a game done very poorly. It's a shame really. Even after an early access/beta period full release is still plagued with all kinds of bugs and bad design choices.

01-09-2016,0,0,508,FALSE,1,The game has come along way TLDR Recommended.Description of objectives 1 killer 4 survivors. 4 survivors must powerup 5 generators and leave by one of two exit gates while the killer attempts to hamper progress by sacrificing survivors to "The Entity". Survivors are rewarded for working with each other and aiding in progression to the exit gates. Gameplay is made dynamic through different killers survivors maps and a large assortment of perks to suit your playstyle.Gameplay Very fun to play with friends and a pleasure to play solo as well. You're always a winner whether you successfully escape the killer or not promoting a style of gameplay that almost completely excludes selfish plays (you can't really do much about the purposefully selfish players). Teamwork is essential to survivng this game and with over 200 hours in this game I'm always on edge waiting for the killer to sneak up on me.Servers In a previous iteration of this review I commented on terrible MM which seems to be fixed now. Buying into this game you are not presently getting dedicated servers which means your gameplay is dependent on how good the host's connection is.

20-11-2016,0,0,1382,FALSE,0,This game used to be a lot of fun until recently and here are a few problems that I've noticed (1). The new hunter "The Shade" is faster than the other hunters and is way to op this is imparitive and needs to change immediately. (2). The new map that came with the halloween dlc is small which is fine but they put the same amount of hooks from the other maps in the small map this makes it very hard to not get caught by the hunter. (3). I've noticed that hunters ranging from rank 1 rank 20 have been camping the runners when on the hooks this is making the game not fun anymore. when the hunters are camping they should have a penalty to some degree. (4). The hunters that camp and hook the last person want to get rid of "Survive with Friends" . If this happens then it will almost make the game impossible to play with friends. Please do not get rid of Survive With Friends.Until these changes are met I cannot recommend this game.*Update*Im glad the developers did not get rid of Survive with Friends but 9 out of 10 killers are still camping and it seems that with every single update and "expansion" the devs are making the killers faster and faster also this is a note to the devs "Stop making the killers faster and stop listening to the players that only play killer".,Dead by Daylight

The higher ranks don't complain much because they have perks to counter Freddy. My advice to new players is learn to juke each killer look back pallet loop (to buy time if he's tunneling) and 360 his (if you can but won't work against skilled killers). Hope that helps to future players. See you in the fog!,Dead by Daylight

18-12-2017,0,0,235,FALSE,0,I put down no because there are many other bad things then there are good things.1) The CommunityThis game has the most TOXIC community out of every game. Even worse than Overwatch. Everybody is just rude and cancerous. Nobody respects people anymore. When I first got the game I guess I was in a small zen period when people are nice. Now it's just toxic/salty survivors and killers/survivors.2) The GameplayThe gameplay isn't bad at all. It's just when it comes to Killer v. Survivor. Survivor has so many better options to survive than the killer but the killer has so many cancerous methods that ruin the game for everyone. The balancing for killer/survivor is not good. Survivors are OP AF devs. Pleae fix this.The main problem this game is bad is because of the SWF ( Survive With Friends ) Mode. It allows friends to tag along and go against killers with friends but the problem is the toxicity of these SWF games ruins the entire game. If they lose they get salty and triggered accuse you of being and trash talk. If they win the STILL TRASH TALK.3) The Perks + ItemsPerks are unbalanced as . Survivors just keep getting buffed and killers just keep getting nerfed. All because the opinions of the new players who say everything on killer is OP. And the devs of the game ACTUALLY LISTEN TO IT. I can't play killer anymore 1/2 the time because i'll get put against somebody who is so much better than their rank. When ranks reset it destroy's everything about this game. P3 people with over thousands of hours get put against people with less than 100. It destroys the game makes them salty makes the devs nerf killer and make the game even more unbalanced than it already is!Survivor items are also way better than killer addons and stuff as well. Nothing more to be said.,Dead by Daylight

Teasing me all game. Tried to kill him no matter what and I couldnt. Everyone escapes and Im just more annoyed at this game.And to make it even better to prove how bad this community is!!I get 4 messages on my wall of a fact of how bad of a player I am.

20-06-2017,1,1,1,FALSE,0,It was on sale. I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. Played it for an hour. Regret buying it.As a survivor there's no real reward in completing generators. Sure you just move on to the next one (where there's 5 in total) and so on. Whenever the killer gets you there is a "Press to wiggle" function. This gives you a chance to break free from the killer and escape. He then drags your over to a hook. where he will impel you untill a survior comes to your aid. It would've been a great feature if the hooks weren't 2 inches from each other. And if you are new to the game and are a low level character there's not much fun in it for you. You have to grind and grind your character to a certain level before you can start to have a slight of a chance. And those perks includes things like tool boxes which makes you repair generators faster a simple flashlight so you can see! and so on. This game introduces itself in the worst way. Looks like fun when you watch someone else play it. And it doesn't explain you that you need to put hours into it before you can perhaps enjoy it.

23-11-2016,0,0,496,FALSE,1,Nov 2017 This game is reaching the potential that it first had the developers are far more thoughtful when it comes to problems they dont rush to bring out unbalanced DLC to make more money. This game is a lot of fun.You need a thick skin to play killer you will always have salty survivors you killed being toxic. BUT if you play this game with the intention of it being for fun and dont care about dying or about making sure someone dies on a hook (camping) then this game is a whole lot of fun. Try it you might just love it.Nov 2016 This game all depends on your outlook. If you are easily triggered by other players features in a game that make it unfair or developers that dont fix issues that are underlying in the game (camping Infinites etc) then this game wont be for you.Its got issues which are slowly being worked out. There should be a patch on the day I am writing this review to lessen the grind for perks and prestige. HOWEVER if you play this game for fun (and not too focused on getting points or the full win) then this game is fantastic. If you play the game how the devs envisioned it to be played (its not too hard to work out what the wanted dont be a and ruin the game for other people i.e camping) then this game is very good fun especially with teammates. You must have a thick skin though and be prepared to ignore the salt that happens at the end of every game from the people that will whine at you. Killer get this much worse so many surviors will rage at you regardless of what you did in the game.,Dead by Daylight

Most people who say thease things have alot of hours on the game alot of hours on the game means you enjoyed it i did and i still do.

22-06-2016,0,0,34,FALSE,1,Dead By Daylight is a great horror game.I bought the deluxe edition the artwork ost and masks for payday were worth the price in my opinion So Now to the real game.So this game was a wonderful horror game.They were great at making us fear the killer.The sudden shocks and the heartbeats makes the game more realistic.Although there are a few stuff that you can use to make the game easier the killer also could use it as well.This game has a fair balance between killers and survivors which is good although the killer is faster and has more senses than survivors killers make noises which makes it obvious for survivors.On the other hand Survivors only make noises if they fail at repairing a generator.The Camera is quite nice with the third and first person thing.Pros Great GameplayMatching Soundtrack Fair Balance of ClassesGood artworkAwesome EnvironmentsGets the 'spooky feel' to the gameCons a few bugsMultiplayer survivors quit easily even in game.No full storyline we only know a bit of each character and none of each killers.Result 9/10The game itself is very interesting yet the bugs and how survivors can quit easily in multiplayer is quite annoying.The story itself isnt too clear yet the great and Terrifying gameplay would make the game worth the price.(voted this for better than expected),Dead by Daylight

22-09-2017,0,0,24,FALSE,0,I honestly never do reviews and could care less to do them but this game has really struck a cord. I bought this game while it was on sale a week ago and as soon as I played it I "screamed" with horror and joy. There was finally a horror game I could play with friends and have fun with. However once I started playing more I noticed some killers seemed a tier above others and completely overpowered. So I looked at the list of killers and soon realized that those characters were the ones you had to buy. I initially shrugged it off and thought maybe it was just coincidence that those were the ones always beating my friends and me. But the more we played the more I saw the trend of us losing to these "pay to win" killers. You would run into someone who has over 400 hrs in game but were low rank with these killers and being new players to this game we would get creamed.Now I know it isn't all fair with the normal killers so I think things should change there but my gosh the skill difference between these paid killers and normal survivors (especially for new players) can just ruin the entire game! I mean it gets pretty annoying when you have Michael Meyers slashing you from 4 ft away and follow you through every obstacle and gaining on you to be killed. Then have the killer at the end of the game calling you "an alternative name for a cat" and to do better (even though he has 500 hrs in game and ranked the lowest you can be).Honestly I would rather watch Zombeavers than play a potentially great horror game.,Dead by Daylight
07-11-2016,0,0,424,FALSE,1,Pros Great gameplay Sound has a massive role in this game which turns it much better Intense moments as a survivor Monthly updates and DLCs This game can be played in lot of ways the game makes you choose between the objective and being out of risk and risking your life in order to help your teammates and get more score and in game money. Developers listen to the community as they implemented the "Survive with friends" mechanicCons Could be repetitive for some people in that case you would feel the game costs much more then it should. You may experience some glitches The servers are buggy and it might cause a big amount of waiting time and joining people who are out of your skill levelIf they haven't fixed the servers yet 9/10If they did fix it 10/10,Dead by Daylight

22-10-2017,0,0,104,FALSE,1,very fun game I dont know why people diss it soo much for my first couple of hours the game was hard and confusing but once you get the hang of it youre golden stealthing around the killer when they are just feet away from you or nearly missing a skill check that could give you away.

Most of them technical but still playable. I really recommend this game if you want to have a good time. However get some friends to play it with. Some of the community are.... volatile.

Still plenty of fun to play when you get to play.If they ever fix matchmaking I would definitely recommend (latest patch indicated issues were resolved that were not. At least a step in the correct direction).11/13 Update I am still going to leave this as a negative review. Matchmaking is still ed however you can now play a game (it's just not going to be matched very well). The developers focus too much on introducing new content and doing cash grabs rather than fixing the game which is a very unfortunate thing. Still fun to play just a very much broken game that they show no intentions of fixing.,Dead by Daylight

For example the revamp of the blood web to have have lesser nodes and the choice within 2 perks instead of one. Really helpful update!

25-07-2018,1,1,130,FALSE,1,The game is fun the community what's ruining this game. Killers want to nerf Survivors to death and Survivors want to nerf Killers to death. In my opinion just remove all the perks and item add ons and maybe some offerings too. I really hope that the devs are not just buffing only killers/survivors and nerfing the other to death. The minor bugs in my opinion are funny so it's not that big of a problem but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be fixed. The game is fun overall and I really like to play the game I play for fun. Other people take the game too serious that's why they are just toxic as hell. Devs keep up the good work and don't listen to the community just play the game yourselves and balance the game by your choice.,Dead by Daylight

23-12-2016,0,0,104,FALSE,1,Product received for free. I played 11 hours of this game over the two days it was available for a free weekend. I love it. It's my favourite game and I dont even have it now but I definitely plan on getting it ASAP.The killers all have a unique killing tactic that the player can customise slightly and use in whatever way they want and though the survivors all start off with only different physical looks to each other with the exact same skills you can get a lot of different perks of different availability and ease of use leading up to their unique perks.I'm in love with the art style and gameplay as a whole though I do struggle against The Hag but oh well. It's an awesome game and I really do recommend getting it.Edit Having now bought the game it remains as my favourite. I've levelled up a lot and the game never ceases to get better in my opinion. I really think it's worth it. Anyways enjoy!,Dead by Daylight

As I am writing this I am waiting 20 minutes just to get into a game please stop with the updates. As of right now I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone until the main issue of actually getting to play the game is fixed.,Dead by Daylight

24-07-2016,0,0,75,FALSE,0,I've played the game for a while now and I've had fun with the game so far but now we come to where the game stops working. When you reach a certain point in the game where most player knows the "best places" to run to when they see the killer this is where the game have completely broken. It is intended that the survivors must hide or work together to outwit the killer not just use "infinite juke spots" where it is quite impossible as killer to stop or catch the survivors.This makes the killer to suddenly completely miserable it is a bad section of "Tom and Jarry" a stupid hunter being ridiculed by a small mouse and it's not the one compares measurements with a dangerous killer.It makes me sad because it's a great game right up to this point and I would like to see it done otherwise I do not think it can develop more and probably ends when the other games in the same genre is released.,Dead by Daylight

30-07-2016,0,0,248,FALSE,0,This game may be fun in concept but it is the most bug filled game I've ever seen. The way you get most out of it is just to screw around with your friends to have fun. Every other game you WILL find a bug that prevents you from doing something. YOU WILL find a killer that has likely over 300 latency that rubber bands your character all over the map. Devs WILL refuse to cater to the public opinion and refuse to balanced or patch things. It is so blatantly obvious that the devs wanted to cash in on some quick bucks with an unfinished game. It's fun if you have a group of 4 friends to play this game with. But if you're a solo player trying match making? I would never recommend this even with a gun pointing at me.,Dead by Daylight
30-07-2016,0,0,156,FALSE,0,ranking system needs to be fixed pls rank 20 vs a rank 1 killer like really ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,Dead by Daylight
26-07-2016,0,0,0,FALSE,0,No ai poor tutorials very little chance to start playing without everyone off.I can't recommend this game because I don't feel as though I'll ever have the chance to start playing without ruining it for everyone else. It feels like I'm trying to enter a club and I don't meet the proper requirements when I start. This would be less of a bother if I had ai bots to fail in front of a proper tutorial or at the very least a method of organizing players by their ranks so I'd fail as much as everyone else. This game has none of the above. (IF it does have a method of organizing players by rank then it seems awfully strange how everyone is already at their top ranks and nobody seems to be new to this at all considering how I was just dropped in the middle of expirienced players. Twice.) As a killer you can't just kill a survivor. You'll have to attack the survivor then drag his/her body to a meat hook HOPING that another survivor didn't break it all within a certain period of time. I've been told that you CAN kill a downed survivor if you can find a "memento" which I find to be completely rediculous. If you're a killer aren't you supposed to.....well kill people!?As a survivor fixing a generator requires a quicktime action. Because the developers will not have mentioned this ANYWHERE you will most likely fail the first time you touch a generator and either get slaughered because of it or hurt your team's chances at survival because of it.This isn't tf2 pd2 csgo etc. where you can fail in front of ai bots or recieve proper tutorials. This is a polished yet unfinished game that you have to pay for in more than one way. It MIGHT improve over time but as of now I wouldn't recommend you play it at all unless if you know 2 3 other people who also play it.If you want a good slasher game where you play as the killer I'd recommend "Party Hard". It's storyline is decent most of your attacks are stealthy and strategic and the best part You aren't expected to know what you're doing before you're supposed to know what you're doing.,Dead by Daylight
06-07-2016,1,2,6,FALSE,1,Fun game very sastisfying to slaughter your friends!,Dead by Daylight
06-07-2016,1,2,182,FALSE,1,Product received for free. The direction of the game is very well. I would definitely recommend it to people who love games with endless hours of playability and a new difficulty in every match. While there are lots of cons to this game such as no party system and hook camping the game is in early access. Pro tip If the killer is a hook camper continue to work on generators. As the hooked survivor is hanging and being camped you will have plenty of time to repair generators.Why should I buy this game? Dead by Daylight has unlimited playablility. While the objective is the same it never feels repetitive to me. Just like CSGO or any other game. If you want to sink your heart and soul into a game Dead by Daylight may be the game for you. What's to come? The developers are working on a party system as of this review and plan to add more maps items survivors and killers. The game in its current state is well priced and really worth it. Why should I believe you? Maybe you shouldn't. But give the game a go it's definitely worth your while. Most negative reviews are about the bugs but I find the bugs to not be that game ruining at all. Playtime as of review 47 hours,Dead by Daylight
27-07-2016,0,0,41,FALSE,0,The fact that the killer can leave mid game and cause you to loose a survivor rank is just idiotic and should have been fixed before they even released the ranking system in the first place... not happy with this game.,Dead by Daylight
27-07-2016,0,0,3,FALSE,0,This is maybe 20% of a game. Not worth the money at all with all the bugs and problems. I have 3.5 hrs on record and probably only 40 minutes spent actually getting to play the game.,Dead by Daylight

But after the recent update (which I couldn't even install till I uninstalled the game 2 times) I can't even join a lobby without my game crashing or being sent back to the "join lobby" button. It worked before but now I can't even play.,Dead by Daylight
27-07-2016,0,0,1208,FALSE,1,Alright. First check how many hours I've had in this game. That alone should be saying something. (I was job hunting and had plenty of time alas those days are over)I could write a 10 page review on this marvelous masterpiece but I will keep it short and sweet This is why you NEED to buy Dead by Daylight.Best 18 20 bucks I've spent in AWHILE. As a lifelong gamer I really can say this is a top 10 favorite.The pros ++ The music and sound effects alone make the experience literally get your heart beating faster. Hell I think it even boosts your metabolism because of how on edge you can become.+ The game looks pretty cool. I like the style of landcape etc. The maps they have now 3 main areas with smaller sub areas are incredible as they are now but there are still updates and new maps in the future. I've played easily over 100 matches and in 3 maps I can say with confidence that it has NOT gotten old. I'm really impressed as being someone who plays everything from Dark Souls to Elder Scrolls to Fallout.+ If you are like me and loved hide and seek and tag when you were a kid and also now you'll love this because basically this is a "grown up" version of that game.+ The team aspect is excellent. Banding together makes repairing healing and basically ensuring your survival a lot easier and it doesn't feel poorly done or forced. I usually like working alone but this game really makes the working with others aspect appealing.+ The items/loadout works very well. Plenty of offerings to put forward and the items available are straight to the point.+ The stealth aspect and hiding behind objects etc. works nearly flawlessly and the feeling you get when the killer runs RIGHT BY you is unparalleled.+ The multiplayer aspect plus the ability to play with friends makes it that much more entertaining.Negatives Several glitches even in the introductory part of the game while you are waiting in the lobby. That one can be overcome but then there's some really frustrating ones in game especially if the killer's internet is because you rubber band all over or it's choppy and there's lag delays. Although I love the 3 maps I would definitely say more maps would definitely not be out of the question.I'd love to answer any Qs you may have as I almost literally know this game inside out!,Dead by Daylight

06-11-2017,0,0,1016,FALSE,1,I do recommend this game but a little heads up. Its a huge grind fest. You will get trolled by killers and survivors And if you think getting a better rank will stop you from being tunneled and facecamped your wrong. lvls 15 to 10 is the more trolly killers they are on that brink where they still think rank matters and are super try hard.

22-11-2017,0,0,591,FALSE,1,Reccomending this game is very difficult. This game is loaded with gamebreaking bugs and glitches that can make it a frustrating experience. However if I was not frustrated I wouldn't care and this game is one of the best experiences I can have in steam. This game is not beginner friendly in the slightest but that just makes it so much more rewarding when you can finally escape the killer. The meta shifts greatly and currently I am not a fan of the whole pallet looping meta we got going on but that's okay. Constant new updates keep the game fresh as well as fix many issues with the game. Personally I liked daily rituals better when there was a big deal and you could get over 100 thousand bloodpoints but I guess it's okay. Overall this game is highly competitive and for good reason. The rank system could still use some work,Dead by Daylight

30-06-2016,0,0,13,FALSE,0,I really want to like this game check that I actually really do like this game. The night I purchased this I bought it along with four other friends and we played a few hours in a private group the issue came when one person left....We quickly realized that this game has no public match group support so you can solo q or well you can solo q. If you dont happen to have a full group of five people then you arn't even able to private q so basically you are unable to play with friends. More over not only can you not play with friends you can't even play with the community. Basically there are no redeeming social aspects to the game and for that I give it a huge thumbs down. I have read that the dev is "working" on making group play a real thing but before that they want to make sure people who drop out of games early are punished better. I don't understand why this game even has a ranking system or trys to promote any kind of e sports functions. If it was a lets try to survive a psycho killer with your friends that had all the fun and screams that I enjoyed with a full group of people then it would be a home run. Sadly Starbreeze Studios really dropped the ball on this one. I would check back in on this to see if they fix the social issue because it is super fun just not alone.,Dead by Daylight

Anyways even though I was hesitant I bought it. During my time with this game i've dealt with long loading screens and the bug where you can't pick up a survivor as the killer. Yea it sucked whenever that happened. BUT i've been having loads of fun playing this game it's competitive it's a bit scary although you always want more! It just makes you feel so awesome when you survive or when you actually outsmart the survivors and sacrifice all of them.

From the menu screen to the perk tree from the game to the afterwards eveything is downright atmospherically creepy. The "uneasy" horror feeling is very well captured. Whether you're screaming and running from the killer or desperately fixing a generator the game succeeds in bringing out that heart pounding exhilaration of Outlast or Penumbra.However after a few hours you can already see the writing on the walls. The game takes itself a bit too seriously it seems. IMO this game is best as a scary casual experience but like with most games a few select people want it to be more than that. You might be a little noob laughing your off and running around aimlessly with your friends... The killer has over 500 hours of experience has mastered their character of choice has memorized every map layout knows all spawn location patterns all generator points etc. The game's counter to this is a constant balancing tweaking reworking everything from perks to villains. This again in turn supports the feeling that the game is trying to be something its not... some kind of actual competitive skill based gameplay for the few who take it way too seriously rather than the masses who just want fun.I will return in future dates with my friends and update my review accordingly I just hope they make the game more casual terror filled fun as opposed to a competitive wipe the floor meta experience ),Dead by Daylight

25-06-2016,0,0,8,FALSE,1,be the hunted or the hunter this is an amazing game for those that like the trill of the chase and its fun to evade the killer for those heartpumping moments,Dead by Daylight
27-06-2016,6,1,216,FALSE,1,Join lobby.I'm level 1.A guy next to me is level 20.He asks me to leave.I ignore him.He says he does not want to play with noob.I ignore him.Another level 20 joins.The first one keeps asking me to leave.I ignore him.10 minutes into the game.5 engines repaired.Only me and the first guy alive.I open the exitHe gets caught.He cries.He struggles.He wants to live.He looks at me....I ignore him.I escape.10/10 would sacrifice again.,Dead by Daylight
24-06-2016,0,0,8,FALSE,1,ok this game is good but the only down side its thats that you cant creat a lobby and invite your friends and that is allso do i recommend this yes if dont to play with your friends or you dont have friends in genral,Dead by Daylight
24-06-2016,0,0,48,FALSE,1,It's a great game.,Dead by Daylight
25-06-2016,0,0,110,FALSE,1,BRILLIANT AND FAVOURITE GAME!This is an extremely fun game to play with friends. In some cases it is okay to play online however you'll find barely any team mates will help you. Other than that this is a really good horror game!With the addition of Survive with friends it has made the game greatly better you can have hours of fun with your friends with a new experience each time.Additionally some of the killers are annoying *cough* the Wraith *cough* and many killers will just camp you on the hooks like they are babysitting you but everyone has their own play styleSome killers are actually quite cheeky and will team up with you and help you repair generators if you help them kick down barricades/ hit you a few times for points. GETTING INTO GAMESAs of patch 1.0.5 trying to get into games is absolutely horrible you could be sitting in a lobby getting 'no matches found' and then finding that the killer leaves because he is matched with high level players. KILLERS STOP BEING S.OPINIONSPersonally i get randomely taken off the game whilst normally playing due to unknown errors where a message is displayed asking why you were taken off the game which i suppose is good for the developers and their future enhancements.The ranking up system is slightly bad you have the skill tree level which is fantastic then the survivor/killer rank where you have to win numerous games in a row to rank up an XP system of some sort would be prefered (opinion)Again the game is really fun when managing to get into a game and i play i have much fun playing it for hours on end,Dead by Daylight
25-06-2016,2,4,247,FALSE,1,I don't really feel like I need to review this game. Because of its popularity by now everybody should know what they're buying.It's abit like hide and seek but the killer is always it. You're trapped in an area and need to fix generators to restore power to the door. Open the door to escape sounds pretty simple right? You already know anyway?The replayability of this isn't amazing. I can come back to it occasionally but as you can see I don't have masses of hours on record. Thats because its the same thing over and over. I would still recommend it though especially if you have a group of people that own it. A major downfall for a Twitch streamer is they also VERY TEDIOUSLY don't allow you to rank up in Custom games. If they don't want it to affect ranked they need to at least a seperate system so you actually have a goal or get benefits from playing games. I grew tired very quickly because I play with friends/viewers alot and no end game reward kills it. It's not even that hard to implement. Dev's if you're reading this just please.I'm not a ranked try hard. If I was I would probably say playing Ranked on a broken game would be way too stressful. I'm out on it completely. The glitches are REALLY f**king annoying and you can do really well but t**ts will just immediately leave when they get killed.I feel like the developers are working on this I recommend because of this. I know I've torn this game to pieces but they'll probably add more characters and alot of content. You know what its about you know what you're getting. If you're reading this you think it looks fun. Thats because it is (for a bit) its something you can go back to with friends occasionally when you're. Just be warned it needs alot of work.twitch.tv/LeftResponse#SellOut,Dead by Daylight
27-06-2016,1,1,153,FALSE,1,This game is a great hide and seek game but has a few problems with no friend queues and somtimes its hard to get into a lobby when the game cannot find a match but i hope a lot of the problems can be fixed and could make an immersive survival horror game.p.s windows in the ironworks of misery+survivor killer getting mugged off a lot,Dead by Daylight
30-06-2016,1,1,0,FALSE,1,Started the game.Died within 30 seconds.10/10 would get spawn killed again.,Dead by Daylight
24-06-2016,0,0,2,FALSE,1,After reading the reviews (yes even the bad ones) I decided to give the game a try. I'll address the popular negative review points.**BUGS** I haven't encountered a lot of bugs just one. Sometimes when i'm trying to crouch and move I just stop moving. And I'm not sure if it's my computer's problem or the map's. I have played all 3 maps and it happened in all of them.**LOBBY ERRORS**I had wait times of less than a minute connecting as a survivor you do get the "failed to join lobby" error but you just have to re click the "join lobby" until you get one. Never took me more than 2 clicks. I feel like the issue is mostly not enough killers (killers make lobbys) and too many survivors. Reading the reviews made it sound a lot worse than it actually was and this is at best a slight annoyance like seriously REALLY minscule. **PARTY GAMES**Devs are working on it and by their developer updates it seems like it's coming along swimmingly. Honestly I don't have anyone else to even play with so this is not a deal breaker for me. **BETA VS FULL RELEASE**As I did not have access to the beta I cannot really comment on this The only issues I kinda have with this full realease I wish there were more maps survivors and killers. Hopefully more will be coming I haven't heard anything about that.Whew! Now that we got the main complaints out of the way. Let's talk...**GAMEPLAY**I actually had a lot of fun with this. The soundtrack is great and the mechanics are awesome. Fortunately I didn't deal with any window chessing people rage quiting and my rank managed to stay inttact. Playing as a survivor is actually wikcked fun and it's actually stressful. You can't attack but you can outsmart Just be aware of your surroundings As a killer you have awesome traps and abilities. **IN CONCLUSION**This game has great gameplay and if you're willing to do a few clicks to join a lobby then this game is for you. Definitely worth it hopefully it will improve with future patches.,Dead by Daylight

30-01-2017,0,0,11,FALSE,0,another broken game that waited too long.if thats not enough heres another reason the game is dead we couldnt find anyone with either trying solo play or with each other and with 4 different areas and different internet providers im calling this game as dead.,Dead by Daylight
09-07-2016,0,0,1,FALSE,0,I have just recently played this game i was taken in by it's uniqe killer vs survivors theme and hunting down my freinds was great fun since it involves strategy and thinking outside the box. However this game fell on its face the second i realized you cant even level up in private matches at first it seems understandable they dont want poeple to mine for xp that is untill you realize NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY WITH A LEVEL 1 SURVIVOR and good luck with the match making system that will put you in a group of level 20 people who will imediatly quit apon seieng you forcing you to get lucky on whos in the lobby. This poor execution leaves alot to be desired and needs major overahul before it becomes a playable multiplayer experience.,Dead by Daylight
19-08-2016,0,0,242,FALSE,1,DBD is your every day horror game There aint much else to it. Still a really good game but no game is perfect they all have their flaws.PROS Many hours to put into the game variety of survivers and killers each haveing their own perks and bloodwebs Not a lot of expliotable tactics the survivers must rely on how well they can juke (could be a dumb killer or a smart surviver) Easy to rank upCONS Needs to have dedicated servers instead of killers host killers normally have garbage internet or like across the world Some killers abilitys are stupidly over powerd for example the doctors shock therapy can shock through walls A lot of lobby doging killers when they see the survivers ranksI would recomend any one to get this game.,Dead by Daylight
21-06-2016,0,0,83,FALSE,1,I think this is a great game I was hyped about it when I was looking for some co op horror games. This is a literal horror movie simulator plus the lore I read was quite a interesting touch and a soild connection too the game.,Dead by Daylight
08-12-2016,1,1,2031,FALSE,0,First of all The Game is really good. BUTThe Support is just horrible!!! There is a Bug known for almost a year called "Lost Progress".As the Name already calls it out there is a chance to loose your Progress like i did and now im waiting for more like 1 Month to get Points or anything in exchange but the Support just doesnt care.. Of course it's way more important to release new DLC's and SH** instead of helping the Players with their problem. Already sent 3 Mails wrote personally with a Mod but it changed nothing. edit Got an answer like 1 5 months after the problem occured. I got Bloodpoints in exchange (not enough for the time i played) and my "legacy" skin is gone too. ______________________________________________________________If you wanna play Killer go ahead and buy the Game. But if you want to play Survivor don't even think about it. With each Patch the Developers somehow nerf the Survivors and buff the Killers (With Perks and other Changes) so as a Survivor Main i can't enjoy this Game anymore.,Dead by Daylight
06-06-2018,1,1,140,FALSE,0,Unbalanced game a lot of bugs the networking and matchmaking does not work you get kicked for no reason it freezes you disconnect the game just goes on when you close it. Overall it might be fun with friends if you get it on sale but that s about it. It also lacks broader gameplay as it s basically always the same procedure.,Dead by Daylight
20-09-2018,0,0,3,FALSE,0,Just played a game where the player and killer work together to farm points. No way to leave match or report players. When players ruin a game and devs don't clean up the bad apples I don't see much reason to play. There a so many good games out there I don't need to waste my time on this garbage.,Dead by Daylight

28-06-2017,0,0,693,FALSE,1,90% Of this game is People crying about "Camping" I don't fully understand why though. IF the monster is camping that is 3 gens for FREE! You would be hurting yourself more to Camp as a killer then for the other 4. It is very well balanced BUT the people Make the very good things sound like they are the worst thing in the world. Like body blocking or being a meat shield. They are kinda needed with some of the killers as many can 1 hit you. Also some can be Toxic calling you hacker cheater camper so on and so on. How ever I do NOT wanna scare you away with buying the game. For $30 it was a very nice game. Being lev 0 and being trash. The getting lev 5 10 and we get better and learn the maps. And lev 15 25 you are much better and gettign a good idea of the game. And if your with the max ranks they will 90% of the time have the better perks and save you more. So in english. If your a killer (you get hate) If your a medic you get all the (love) in the world. For newplayers Try to youtube or google a few tips if you need them. Last on the list...HAVE FUN! P.S. *YOUR A KILLER! DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET THE KILL!* AKA camp/play smart/be calm/understand when to stay and watch the guy on the hook and when to walk away,Dead by Daylight

Lackluster matchmaking if you want to play solo killer. Evolve is better in that respect.I will edit my review if any of this changes. But it is not worth the money right now.,Dead by Daylight
